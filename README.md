## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
### What I learned

I learned to build side with mobile-first workflow and adjusting it with grid layout. I spent too long figuring out how to make the last card element to position in the first row. I also learned to use Sass, though I feel like I'm not maximizing its features yet.
